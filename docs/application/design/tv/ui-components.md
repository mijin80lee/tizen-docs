# UI components

Basic UI components in Tizen TV applications are divided into 4 categories:

-   [Navigation elements](ui-components/navigation-elements.md) allow the user to browse content and switch between screens.
-   [Presentation views](ui-components/presentation-views.md) display content in different ways.
-   [User input elements](ui-components/user-input-elements.md) collect user input for specific tasks.
-   [Assist views](ui-components/assist-views.md) provide additional information to the user.
