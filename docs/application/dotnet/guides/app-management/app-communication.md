# Application Data Exchange


The application data exchange features cover the various methods you have to communicate with other applications. You can exchange data between applications through message ports and data controls.

You can use the following application data exchange features in your .NET applications:

-   [Message Port](message-port.md)

    Applications communicate with each other using message ports. You can send and receive messages using the map data format and trusted or untrusted message port instances.

- [Data Control](data-control.md)

    You can exchange SQL- or key-value-type data between applications. All applications can request data shared by other applications, but only service applications can provide their own data.
